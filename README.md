--------BrickBreaker---------

For starting the game, you should mouse-click left, moment in which the ball will go vertically with a constant speed.
The trajectory will be modified only when the ball meets the platform, until the direction of the ball on the horizontal
axis will be modified by this.
For observing the details related to collision/resolution, and the fast ending of the game, speed-up functionalities 
have been implemented (U key) and speed-down(D key) in [0,600] interval.
For switching the background color between black and white, key C can be used.
For restarting the game, key G with be used. For restarting the bricks, key R can be used.
The powerup chance is by default 15%. For 100%, key P can be used.
The keys 1,2,3,4,5,6 represent ambiental delights, left for users to discover.
